I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Alois Knoll for the exciting opportunity to pursue a thesis in the context of the Human Brain Project. My thanks also extends to my advisor Alexander Kuhn who would grant me a great deal of freedom in choosing my topic while also providing feedback whenever necessary.
